# Heart Disease Detection with Machine Learning

## Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model for the detection of heart disease. By analyzing various medical attributes and historical data, the model predicts the likelihood of a patient having heart disease. This README provides an overview of the project, its functionalities, and instructions for usage.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing the machine learning model is [heart_disease_data]. It contains a comprehensive set of features including medical history, and various physiological measurements related to heart health.

## Requirements
Python <br>
Libraries: [NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn]

## Installation
Clone the repository:
```
git clone [https://github.com/daksha11/Heart-Disease-Detector.git]
```

## Usage
<ol>
	<li>Data Preparation:</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Ensure your dataset is in the appropriate format and contains relevant features.</li>
		<li>Preprocess the data if necessary (handling missing values, feature scaling, etc.).</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Training the Model:</li>
	<ul>
		<li>This script trains the machine learning model on the provided dataset.</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Model Evaluation:</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Assess the performance of the trained model using evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.</li>
		<li>Evaluate the model on a separate validation or test dataset.</li>
	</ul>
</ol>

## Inference:
Once the model is trained and evaluated, you can use it for making predictions on new data.
Integrate the model into your application for real-time predictions.
